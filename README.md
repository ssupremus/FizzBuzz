# FizzBuzz

Count from 1 to N
1. print number, BUT
2. if n divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead
3. if n divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead
4. if n divisivble by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead

And then refactor if needed:
1) Try to use only one print (output) for all cases
2) Try to reduce number of conditions
3) Modify to always print both number and fitting words, e.g "3 Fizz"
4) Use hash/dictionary for words instead of multiple conditions, like {3: "Fizz", 5: "Buzz", 7: "Quux"}
5) Make this solution a utility function/class/module, which takes range and dictionary as input
